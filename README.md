# AdventOfCode
This is a repo for the advent of code!

I'll use Python to solve the code for this Code solving challenge.

Usage: 
```sh
python 1.py 1.txt
```
Where `1` stands for the number of the challenge. Example `1` for `Day 1`.

The `.txt` files are for the puzzle inputs.

Each Challenge has two parts.

Each solution should print two lines - the answer for part 1 and part 2 respectively.
